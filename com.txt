Just so everybody knows, this appears to be for a non-gauge cluster according to GMC Pauls website for the dash conversion. I have my cluster out right now and my plug on the back of my full gauge cluster and it has a different color scheme than this diagram. I\u0027m having issues with mine and that\u0027s how I noticed it. Thanks again for taking the time to color this up for the board! __________________ Jim 1970 C/10 Fleetside w/Ghost Flames Lowered 4.5\" front and 4\" rear (Raked) 355/350 Turbo w/shift kit 10\" Redneck Performance Verter w/2500 stall Hooker Super Comps part#2808-1 Performer RPM Air-Gap 12 Bolt w/3:73 gears- Eaton Posi Comp Cams XE262 with 1.6 Crane Energizers, Road Demon 625 and Brodix IK 180 heads",""]],"pageTitle":"Color Wiring Diagram FINISHED - The 1947 - Present Chevrolet \u0026 GMC Truck Message Board Network","title":"","url":"http://67-72chevytrucks.com/vboard/showthread.php?t\u003d185665","hasHeader":true,"headerPosition":"FIRST_ROW","tableType":"LAYOUT","tableNum":13,"s3Link":"common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438044271733.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728004431-00342-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz","recordEndOffset":1046396,"recordOffset":1030002,"tableOrientation":"VERTICAL","textBeforeTable":"Find More Posts by boundstaffpress Visit boundstaffpress\u0027s homepage!
